# What is `Scripted Events Reloaded`?
**Scripted Events Reloaded (SER)** is an SCP:SL plugin for LabAPI that adds a complete custom programming language for server owners to use.

# Why use SER?

## 🎮 Customization and Control
Have a unique idea, but can't find the right plugin? Build it yourself!

- A lucky coin with custom effects? Got it!
- A heavy containment decontamination system? Easy peasy!
- A party in the intercom? Heck yeah!
- A 10% chance for someone to become an ant? Of course!
- And much more...

## 🧠 Learning Potential
SER is a simple entry point into programming languages and SCP:SL plugin development.  
You'll learn key concepts like methods, variables, conditions, events, and more in a straightforward way.

Once you understand the basics and feel limited by SER's features, it's a great time to move on to full plugin development in C#.

## 🗂️ All on the Server
You don't need any external programs to write scripts with SER — just text files and access to your server!

## ⚡ Speed of Development
No need to compile anything! As soon as you save your script, the changes are applied immediately — no server restart required.

## 🛠️ Expanding Command Functionality
Every method in SER is available through the Remote Admin console and the server console, giving you many more options for instant server management.

## 🔌 Plugin Interoperability
SER can interact with other plugins you have installed — as long as they support SER or are built with SER integration in mind.

# Just Another Way to Make Plugins?
Nope. SER is not here to compete with traditional plugins.

To stay simple and approachable, SER doesn't support many of the more advanced features that standard plugin frameworks do.  
**Do not treat this as an all-in-one replacement** for C# plugin development.
